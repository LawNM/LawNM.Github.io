        <p>
            <strong>Persona 1:</strong> This person is outdoorsy. They like to go out into nature and have activities in the park, on the trail or anyplace that is around
           mother nature. It's important for them to be able to go outside and enjoy all the adventure the world has to offer! It's important for them to have an accurate
           weather forcast becuase it allows them to better pack and prepare whatever activity they have planned for the day.

            <strong>Persona 2:</strong> This person is a student. They tend to have short commutes as most of them tend to be from class to class. Their day tends to start
            in the morning and finshes around late afternoon. It's important for them to have the apppropriate clothes for their daily walks to class because otherwise they
            will have to deal with mild problems such as being too hot or cold, or a bit more grievous problems such as being wet.
