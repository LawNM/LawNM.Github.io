                Pancakes. You love them, I love them everybody loves them. From the birth of this town the pancake is arguably the soul of what we are. 
                \Yes indeed it is what makes us, us. The pancake has an important history both on its own and in the town of Preston. 
                Pancakes as we know them today start in the middle ages. 
                Yes indeed, but they were not as called Pancakes instead they were Kingscakes as it was a food the as only permitted for royalty. 
                It was a common desert for royal family members, but after the viva la revolution it became a commoners food when the royal secrets came flooding out. 
                At this point they were called coin cakes and their popularity spread all through out  Europa.<br><br>

                When the Pilgrims came on the Mayflower they didâ€™nt have anyway to make coin cakes so they were mad hungry for some coin cakes when they came here, no cap. 
                So they wanted some coin cakers that were bigger than normal. When they poured the batter they decided to fill up the entire pan and BAM! Pancakes were born. 
                It became a breakfast staple for the american for years.
                Many of the pioneers when they came out west to follow the oregon trail thought it more important to eat pancakes then to make it where they needed to go. 
                So, many of the travelrs set down their things unloaded the carts and settled much of the land before they made it to the West Coast.<br><br>
                
                When Preston was settled it was very important to the townsfolk that they have a lot of pancakes. 
                So shortly after people built houses and trade began to happen every saturday was going to be All-you-can-eat-pancake-day-at-the-park.
                 Yes thats how it began and now every saturday we enjoy pancakes in the beautiful park. Pancakes have continued to be a big part of the culture here.
                  Even appearing in Napoleon Dynamite. Yup Kip was actually just a giant pancake in a man suit. And thats all folks.<br>
