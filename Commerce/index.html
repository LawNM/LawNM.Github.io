                Ark: Lock & Security, got their start in 1982 when the owner John Locke found that he was 
                abosulutly fascinated with how locks worked. It was simple thing he got some bobby pins and went
                to town on every pin and tumbler lock in the house. Unfourtanly after he broke the front door Lock.
                his parents got quite upset. So, then after a month long grounding John was given some old 
                padlocks. After much practice he was given an appretinceship and opened his shop after graduating 
                high school.

            <p>
                What started as backyard Theater turned into the Paramount 5. Phil loved movies, he loved watching them
                and sharing them with others. So he decided that he would get a projector and show movies in his backyard.
                At first the only people were his immediate family. Soon it became friends and their families. What were
                once weekly showing became double features. Then Friday evenings and all day saturday. When Phil had saved enough money
                He bought a closed two screen theater. After more succusses he had the current five screen theater built.
